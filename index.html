               <h2>Planet X2</h2>
               <p>
                  This was the first planet that I teleported to on my journey 
                  across space. This planet was like earth, but it was floating 
                  in a giant sphere of water. I was suprised that I could breathe 
                  so easily consdiering that I am not a fish. The locals say once 
                  the ruler of the planet X1 passed along to space heaven, he shed 
                  a single tear and it burst in the middle of space creating X2.
                  The more time that I spent on this planet the more I felt his 
                  presence. It was almost as if the planet was alive.
               </p>
               <p><b>FUN FACT: </b>I had a fish named X2.</p>
               <p><b>NOT SO FUN FACT: </b>He is burried in my backyard. Seriously...
               with a tomb stone and everything... R.I.P X2✝︎

               <h2>Black Hole</h2>
               <p>
                  As I was teleporting from X2, I got interupted by a black hole 
                  midway to my next destination. It seemed like a huge inconvience 
                  at the time, but once I accepted the situation I was in. It turned 
                  out to be a beautiful experience. I was slowly being sucked into 
                  another dimension in bliss. I had never experienced cross dimension
                  space travel so I was pretty excited to see where I would be taken.
                  As I entered the void, I was shown my entire life in the matter of 
                  seconds and in an instant I was falling out of the other side onto
                  the planet Yorha.

               <h2>Planet Yorha</h2>
               <p>
                  Like a meteor, I crash landed in a burst of flames and debris into Yorha.
                  Once I was able to see straight again, I looked around and realized that 
                  everything was made of metal! This was not an organic planet, but a robot
                  made planet. All the inhabitants on this planet were beeping and booping 
                  all over the place. I was basically a ghost floating around town because
                  no one paid any mind to me. All the robots were busy carrying out tasks.
                  I wasn't too sure what they were all working on until I noticed an
                  engraved branding on all of the robots. It was some sort of nuclear symbol.
                  What could this be? Yorha answered that for me very quickly. In the distance,
                  a giant mushroom cloud appeared and then a massive shock wave knocked 
                  me through 7 factories and sent me soaring to the next planet. I guess 
                  they were making nukes and I was there for their worst day at work.

               <h2>Planet XP</h2>
               <p id = "testP" class = "funParagraph">
                  This time when I flew onto another planet I was able to land on both feet.
                  This planet was very empty. It was green fields and blue skys forever and 
                  ever without a single sign of life besides the grass on the ground. The 
                  lack of noise was both creepy and peaceful at the same time. It felt like 
                  I was in a dream, but instead of counting sheep I was counting spaceships
                  passing by. I wondered for hours on this planet, skipping around and 
                  listening to happy music. I ended up stumbling upon an escalator that lead
                  to the planet that was right next to XP. I stepped on and let the steps carry
                  me to my next destination. It was a long ride so I ended up falling asleep when 
                  I was about a few hours away from my destination. The next time I opened my eyes 
                  I was floating away from XP on a fragment of the escalator. I looked down at XP 
                  and saw a fox with a chainsaw waving at me. I just went back to bed.
               </p>
               <p><b>FUN FACT: </b>It is always day time on XP and the surrounding planets.
                  Scientists say it's because the stars in its solar system shine together
                  as bright as the sun.

               <h2>Planet B901</h2>
               <p>
                 I was disrupted from my sleep when I crash landed yet again onto another planet.
                 This time I crashed onto the planet B901. Everything looked very apocolyptic and 
                 destroyed. As I was looking at my surroundings I saw some rusty cars with turrets 
                 and rocket launchers strapped to them fighting each other. I took cover behind the 
                 piece of the escalator that I was riding on and watched the two opposing sides 
                 fight it out. One of the cars shot a rocket at the other and it launched the car
                 in the air and landed upside down. The driver was crawling out, shouting something
                 about gasoline. The driver that launched the car got out of his car and started 
                 siphoning the last bit of gasoline from the destroyed car and began to consume
                 the gasoline at an alarming rate. The flipped car exploded leaving both of the 
                 drivers horribly injured. I knew then and there that I had to leave this planet
                 as soon as possible, but how? I looked around the desert scape for anything that 
                 could help me in any way to escape. I noticed a red button on the side of the 
                 escalator so I pressed it. It transformed into a giant UFO! I had no time to
                 question it so I just got on and left. 
               </p>
               <p><b>FUN FACT: </b>The "residents" of this planet live off of gasoline and silver spray paint</p>

               <h2>The Unknown Planet</h2>
               <p>
                  I flew away from B901 for a few hours just to make sure there was no sign of
                  that planet anywhere near me. As I was flying I came across this planet
                  that I think has never been discovered before me. It looked somewhat like a 
                  giant eyeball. I was very intrigued so I landed. I stepped out of the UFO 
                  and at first sight I felt like I was in paradise. It was so beautiful and 
                  rich with life, but no sign of any intelignet life forms. It seemed too good 
                  to be true. I took this opportunity to switch up my living situation. The UFO
                  came with a G.E.C.K. which stands for Garden Of Eden Creation Kit. Laying this 
                  device out in an open area would allow the land to be populated with all the
                  resources I needed to start creating my own home and food to live. I'm actually
                  writing this paragraph in my newly built shack. It is very peaceful. I'm still
                  not sure what I want to name this planet. Earth &lt The Unknown Planet.
